# Overview

- This is the VHDL implementation of the `LZW Compression and Decompression` algorithm.

- This code was writen based on the [Java-LZW](https://github.com/AbduEhab/Java-LZW) Repo that I made.

  > I discovered that I absolutly hate VHDL, please don't message me concerning this repo or any code writen in it...

> I won't add an implementation of the LZ77 algorithm.

## Technologies

- `VHDL 98`
- `ISE Design Suite 14.6 (The only software that my university could provide)` 

---

## Usage

- If you really want to, you can upload the code to a `spartin-3`.

## Stuff to do

- [ ] Implement the LZ77 algo (Not gonna touch VHDL again)
- [ ] Delete Entire repo someday
